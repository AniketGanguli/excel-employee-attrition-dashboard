## ⚠️ Problem Encountered & Solution

**Issue:** When slicers were applied, pivot tables excluded fields with 0 count, which caused layout breaks and formula errors due to cell reference shifts.

**Fix:**
- Tried enabling "Show items with no data" (option was greyed out).
- **Final solution:** Created a DAX measure in Power Pivot to return `0` instead of blank:

```DAX
EmployeeCount := IF(COUNTA(EmployeeID) = BLANK(), 0, COUNTA(EmployeeID))
